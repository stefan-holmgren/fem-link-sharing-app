# TODOS

- check all error states for:
  - `/login`
  - `/signup`
  - `/forgot-password`
  - `/reset-password`
- prefetch the list? currently the <List> component is fetching the list on mount, causing a flicker
- you can reset password while being logged in - is that ok?
- logout? - currently you can't logout
- make the scroll buttons animate in and out
